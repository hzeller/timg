// latency. Since this is the last step where everything to be written is
// already determined, the timing can be fixed best here.

    // SeqType::ControlWrite are meant for short writes that are not associated
    // with picture frames, e.g. switching cursor on or off. They are
    // always written, even after interrupt_received became true and are
    // not subject to frame skipping. The "end_of_frame" parameter is ignored.
    //
    // The other SeqTypes are used for emitting image content:
    //
    // With a SeqType::Immediate, buffer is written, no wait afterwards;
    // the "end_of_frame" duration is ignored.
    //
    // With SeqType::StartOfAnimation and SeqType::AnimationFrame, the
    // "end_of_frame" duration determines how long after the beginning of the
    // animation the sent buffer is finished.
    // For an animation, the first frame is marked with StartOfAnimation, all
    // following frames are AnimationFrames with an increasing duration from
    // the start. This establishes the absolute time difference between the
    // start of the Animation and the current frame. So the duration for
    // StartOfAnimation is 1/fps, next AnimationFrame at 2/fps and so on.
    // This allows to ...
    //   (a) be independent of upstream latencies as only when the first
    //       frame of an animation arrives here and is emitted, the clock
    //       starts ticking.
    //   (b) avoid time-skews. Even if a frame takes a little bit longer, the
    //       next will try to finish in earlier as the frame-time is absolute.
