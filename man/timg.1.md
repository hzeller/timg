# NAME

timg - A terminal image and video viewer

# SYNOPSIS

  **timg** [&lt;*options*&gt; &lt;*image/video*&gt; [&lt;*image/video*&gt;...]

# DESCRIPTION

Show images, play animated gifs, scroll static images or play videos in the
terminal. Even show PDFs if needed.

Useful if you want to have a quick visual check without leaving the comfort
of your shell and having to start a bulky image viewer. Sometimes this is the
only way if your terminal is connected remotely via ssh. And of course if you
don't need the resolution. While icons typically fit pixel-perfect, larger
images are scaled down to match the resolution.

The command line accepts any number of image/video filenames that it shows
in sequence one per page or in a grid in multiple columns, depending on your
choice of **-\-grid**. The output is emitted in-line with minimally messing
with your terminal, so you can simply go back in history using your terminals'
scroll-bar (Or redirecting the output to a file allows you to later
simply **cat** that file to your terminal. Even **less -R** seems to be happy
with such output).

The special filename "-" stands for standard input, so you can read
an image from a pipe. If the input from a pipe is a video, use the **-V** option
(see below).

Under the hood, timg uses GraphicsMagick to open and decode a wide
range of image formats. It also uses libav to decode and play videos or images
from files and URLs. With **-I** or **-V** you can choose to use only one of
these file decoders (GraphicsMagick or libav respectively).

# OPTIONS

## General Options
**-g** *&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;*
:     Output image to fit inside given geometry. By default, the size is
     determined by the available space in the terminal. The image is
     scaled to fit inside the available box to fill the screen; see **-W** if
     you want to fill the width.

**-p** *&lt;[h|q|k|i]&gt;*, **-\-pixelation**=*[h|q|k|i]*
:    Choice for pixelation of the content. Value 'h' chooses unicode half
     block characters, while 'q' chooses quarter blocks.
     The choice 'k' chooses kitty-graphics protocol, 'i' the iTerm2 graphics
     protocol.

     Half blocks have a pixel aspect ratio of about 1:1 and allow to represent
     colors correctly, but they look more 'blocky'.

     Quarter blocks will have a pixel aspect ratio of 1:2 (timg will stretch
     the picture accordingly, no worries), and can only
     represent colors approximately, as the four quadrant sub-pixels can only
     be foreground or background color. This increases the spatial resolution
     in x-direction at expense of slight less color accuracy.
     It makes it look less 'blocky' and usually better.

     There are terminal emulators that allow to display high-resolution
     pictures. If timg is detecting to run in a Kitty, iTerm2 or WezTerm,
     the corresponding mode is auto-selected. You can choose the modes
     explicitly with -pk (Kitty) or -pi (iTerm2 protocol, also implemented
     by WezTerm).

     Default is 'quarter' unless the terminal is graphics-capable.

**-\-compress**
:   For the graphics modes: this switches on compression for the transmission to
    the terminal. This uses more CPU on timg, but is desirable when connected
    over a slow network.

**-C**, **-\-center**
:    Center image(s) and title(s) horizontally.

**-W**, **-\-fit-width**
:    Scale to fit width of the available space. This means that the height can
     overflow, e.g. be longer than the terminal, so might require scrolling to
     see the full picture.
     Default behavior is to fit within the allotted width *and* height.

**-\-grid**=&lt;*cols*&gt;[x&lt;*rows*&gt;]
:    Arrange images in a grid. If only one parameter is given, arranges in a
    square grid (e.g. **-\-grid=3** makes a 3x3 grid). Alternatively, you can
    choose columns and rows that should fit on one terminal
    (e.g. **-\-grid=3x2**)

**-w** &lt;*seconds*&gt;
:   Wait time between images when multiple images are given on the command
    line. Fractional values are allowed, so **-w3.1415** would wait approximately
    Ï€ seconds between images.

**-a**
:   Switch off anti aliasing. The images are scaled down to show on the
    minimal amount of pixels, so some smoothing is applied for best visual
    effect. This switches off that smoothing.

**-b** &lt;*background-color*&gt;
:    Set the background color for transparent images. Common HTML/SVG/X11
     color strings are supported, such as **purple**,
     ***#00ff00** or **rgb(0, 0, 255)**.

     As a 'special' color, **auto** is allowed, which attempts to query the
     terminal for its background color (Best effort; not all terminals support
     that). If detection fails, the fallback is 'black'.

     The special value **none** switches off blending background color.

**-B** &lt;*checkerboard-other-color*&gt;
:    Show the background of a transparent image in a checkerboard pattern with
    the given color, which alternates with the **-b** color.
    Supported color specifications like in **-b**.

**-\-pattern-size**=&lt;*size-factor*&gt;
:   Scale background checkerboard pattern by this factor.

**-\-auto-crop**[=&lt;*pre-crop*&gt;]
:    Trim same-color pixels around the border of image before displaying. Use
    this if there is a boring even-colored space aorund the image which uses
    too many of our available few pixels.

    The optional pre-crop is number of pixels to unconditionally trim
    all around the original image, for instance to remove a thin border. The
    link in the [EXAMPLES](#EXAMPLES) section shows an example how this
    improves showing an xkcd comic with a border.

**-\-rotate**=&lt;*exif*|*off*&gt;
:   If 'exif', rotate the image according to the exif data stored
    in the image. With 'off', no rotation is extracted or applied.

**-\-clear**
:   Clear screen before *first* image. This places the image at the top of the
    screen.

    There is an optional parameter '*every*' (**-\-clear=every**), which will
    clean the screen before every image. This only makes sense if there is no
    **-\-grid** used and if you allow some time to show the image of course,
    so good in combination with **-w**.

**-U**, **-\-upscale=[i]**
:   Allow Upscaling. If an image is smaller than the terminal size, scale
    it up to fit the terminal.

    By default, larger images are only scaled down and images smaller than the
    available pixels in the terminal are left at the original size (this
    helps assess small deliberately pixelated images such as icons in their
    intended appearance). This option scales up smaller images to fit available
    space.

    The long option allows for an optional parameter **-\-upscale=i**
    that forces the upscaling to be in integer increments to keep the 'blocky'
    appearance of an upscaled image without bilinear scale 'fuzzing'.

**-V**
:    This is a video, directly read the content as video and don't attempt to
    probe image decoding first.

    Usually, timg will first attempt to interpret the data as image, but
    if it that fails, will fall-back to try interpret the file as video.
    However, if the file is coming from stdin, the first bytes used to probe
    for the image have already been consumed so the fall-back would fail in
    that case... Arguably, this should be dealt with automatically but isn't :)

    Long story short: if you read a video from a pipe, use **-V**.
    See link in [EXAMPLES](#EXAMPLES) section for a an example.

**-I**
:    This is an image, don't attempt to fall back to video decoding. Somewhat
    the opposite of **-V**.

**-F**, **-\-title**
:    Print filename as title above each image.

**-f** &lt;*filelist-file*&gt;
:    Read a list of image filenames to show from this file. The list needs
     to be newline separated.
     This option can be supplied multiple times in which case it appends
     to the end of the list of images to show.
     If there are also filenames on the command line, they will be shown at
     the very end.

     Absolute filenames in the list are used as-is, relative filenames are
     resolved relative to the filelist-file itself.

**-o** &lt;*outfile*&gt;
:    Write terminal image to given filename instead of stdout.

**-E**
:    Don't hide the cursor while showing images.

**-\-threads**=&lt;*n*&gt;
:    Run image decoding in parallel with n threads. By default, half the
     reported CPU-cores are used.

**-\-color8**
:   Use 8 bit color mode for terminals that don't support 24 bit color
    (only shows 6x6x6 = 216 distinct colors instead of 256x256x256 = 16777216).

**-\-version**
:    Print version and exit.

**-h**, **-\-help**
:    Print command line option help and exit.

## For Animations, Scrolling, or Video

Usually, animations are shown in full in an infinite loop. These options
limit infinity.

**-t**&lt;*seconds*&gt;
:   Stop an animation after these number of seconds.
    Fractional values are allowed.

**-\-loops**=&lt;*num*&gt;
:    Number of loops through a fully cycle of an animation or video.
    A value of *-1* stands for 'forever'.

    If *not* set, videos loop once, animated images forever unless there is
    more than one file to show. If there are multiple files on the command line,
    animated images are only shown once if **-\-loops** is not set to prevent
    the output get stuck on the first animation.

**-\-frames**=&lt;*frame-count*&gt;
:    Only render the first *frame-count* frames in an animation or video.
    If frame-count is set to 1, the output behaves like a static image.

## Scrolling

**-\-scroll**[=&lt;*ms*&gt;]
:    Scroll horizontally with an optional delay between updates (default: 60ms).
     In the [EXAMPLES](#EXAMPLES) section is an example how to use ImageMagick
     to create a text that you then can scroll with **timg** over the terminal.

**-\-delta-move**=&lt;*dx*&gt;\:&lt;*dy*&gt;
:    Scroll with delta x and delta y. The default of 1:0 scrolls it horizontally,
    but with this option you can scroll vertically or even diagonally.

# RETURN VALUES

Exit code is

**0**
:    On reading and displaying all images successfully.

**1**
:    If any of the images could not be read or decoded or if there was no
    image provided.

**2**
:    If an invalid option or parameter was provided.

**3**
:    If timg could not determine the size of terminal (not a tty?). Provide
    **-g** option to provide size of the output to be generated.

**4**
:    Could not write to output file provided with **-o**.

**5**
:    Could not read file list file provided with **-f**.


# ENVIRONMENT

**TIMG_USE_UPPER_BLOCK**
:     If this environment variable is set to the value **1**, timg will use the
     U+2580 - 'Upper Half Block' (&#x2580;) Unicode character.

    To display pixels, timg uses a Unicode half block and sets the foreground
    color and background color to get two vertical pixels. By default, it uses
    the U+2584 - 'Lower Half Block' (&#x2584;) character to achieve this goal. This
    has been chosen as it resulted in the best image in all tested terminals
    (konsole, gnome terminal and cool-retro-term). So usually, there is no
    need to change that. But if the terminal or font result in a funny output,
    this might be worth a try. This is an environment variable because if it
    turns out to yield a better result on your system, you can set it once
    in your profile and forget about it.

**TIMG_FONT_WIDTH_CORRECT**
:   A floating point stretch factor in width direction to correct for fonts
    that don't produce quite square output.

    If you notice that the image displayed is not quite the right aspect
    ratio because of the font used, you can modify this factor to make it
    look correct. Increasing the visual width by 10% would be setting it to
    *TIMG_FONT_WIDTH_CORRECT=1.1* for instance.

    This is an environment variable, so that you can set it once to best fit
    your terminal emulator of choice.

**TIMG_ALLOW_FRAME_SKIP**
:   Set this environment variable to 1 if you like to allow timg to drop frames
    when play-back is falling behind.
    This is particularly useful if you are on a very slow remote terminal
    connection that can't keep up with playing videos. Or if you have a very
    slow CPU.

# EXAMPLES

Some example invocations including scrolling text or streaming an
online video are put together at <https://github.com/hzeller/timg#examples>

# KNOWN ISSUES

This requires a terminal that can deal with Unicode characters and 24 bit
color escape codes. This will be problematic on really old installations or
if you want to display images on some limited text console.

The option **-V** should not be necessary for streaming video from stdin;
timg should internally buffer bytes it uses for probing.
